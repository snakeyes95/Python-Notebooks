Earlier the State Governments used to increase circle rate for stamp duty.
People used to pay stamp duty as per circle rate but used to make purchasing as per actual rate.
Now, this is against the Income Tax law.
As per the law, no purchasing will be carried out below circle rate.
This has created a lot of problems for the farmers.
They are not able to sell their agricultural land.
The Government is not going to help them in case of emergency because this Government is anti-farmers.
It is a major problem before the country.
